# Student Registration System

This is a Java-based **Student Registration System** that allows users to manage student records efficiently. The system provides functionalities such as registering students, deleting records, searching students, storing and loading data from files, and handling student grades based on module marks.

## Features
- âœ… Check available seats
- âœ… Register students with an ID
- âœ… Delete students from the system
- âœ… Find students by their ID
- âœ… Store student details into a file
- âœ… Load student details from a file
- âœ… View students sorted by name
- âœ… Add additional student details (name and module marks)

## Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 11+ recommended)
- File Handling (for data persistence)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP concepts)
